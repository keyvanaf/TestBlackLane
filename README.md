# TestBlackLane

This is a sample code for hiring assessment of Blacklane GmbH in Berlin.
This code include Registration page request which I  added more features like Google map.


### Dependency
* jQuery JavaScript Library v1.9.1
* Bootstrap v3.3.7 
* QUnit 2.3.2
* Bootstrap (plugin): validator.js v0.11.9(Unfortunately,it doesn't support async custom validator and I need to modify runValidators method  in my app.js file and add async custom validator feature because i want validate address with google map api)
* pickadate.js v3.5.6
* jquery-placepicker(Unfortunately,I need to modify that and add modal feature for map )
